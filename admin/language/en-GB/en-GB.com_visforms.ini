Don't forget string start ^ and end $ characters in your regex. It is not possible to use additional pattern flags like i. <strong>Please notice that the validation plugin does only validate against the regex, if the user has made an input in the form field. So if the user leaves the input empty the regex example above will not result in a form validation error. You have to enable the "_QQ_"required"_QQ_" option in addtion to the regex if you want the empty input to be considered invalid too.</strong> Please insert a "_QQ_"Custom Error Text"_QQ_" that matches your custom validation."
